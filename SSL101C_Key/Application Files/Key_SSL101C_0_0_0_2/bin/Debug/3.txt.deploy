Mohammed is a third year undergraduate student studying epidemiology. His professor is highly regarded in the field and Mohammed is very excited to study under him. While trying to replicate one of his professor's experiments, Mohammed notices that another student has made a mistake while calculating the data for the experiment. In one of the equations, one of the signs is around the wrong way. This has made the results of the experiment seem really positive. However, when Mohammed does his calculations, he notices that his results aren't very good at all. Mohammed does the calculations multiple times. He consults a few  other students, and they all come up with the same thing. It isn't an  assignment, and students are allowed to collaborate and work together, so Mohammed tells the student about the mistake. However, the other student shrugs and refuses to change it because it is the same as the  one used in the original paper. What is Mohammed required to do? 

Check one option.

Mohammed isn't required to do anything.
T
He must tell the professor because the student is falsifying
F
He must go to the dean of the faculty and accuse the other student of academic misconduct.
F

Mohammed isn't required to do anything.
[Because this isn't an assessment and the results will not be published, Mohammed isn't required to do anything. However, this is still an unethical act and Mohammed could go and discuss the matter with his professor or course facilitator. He could explain the situation while leaving the offending student's name anonymous. This might help prevent such behaviour happening in future assessments]

Consider the following situation.
Mohammed is a third year undergraduate student studying epidemiology. His professor is highly regarded in the field and Mohammed is very excited to study under him. However, after seeing another student use an incorrect equation while trying to replicate one of his professor's experiments, Mohammed notices that his professor made a small error when calculating the data for the original experiment. When Mohammed fixes the error, it changes the results so much that the conclusion isn't correct any more. Mohammed checks  the original and his own multiple times but he still gets the same result. Mohammed is very concerned because the paper with the published  results of the experiments his professor did has been referenced many  times. What should Mohammed do? 

Check one option.

Bring this to his professor's attention as soon as possible.
T
Go to the head of the school and tell her that his professor has been falsifying his results.
F
Do nothing. Mohammed obviously isn't doing the calculations  properly as his professor is much more intelligent and knows much more about the subject than he does.
F

Bring this to his professor's attention as soon as possible.
[The best thing that Mohammed can do in this situation is bring the error to his professor's attention. This way, if Mohammed's calculations are correct, his professor can act on it immediately and withdraw the paper. If Mohammed's calculations are incorrect and his professor's original calculations are perfect, then asking his professor to clarify will help Mohammed to learn how to do the calculations properly]

His professor  does nothing. What should Mohammed do now? 

Check one option.

Go to the head of the school and tell her that his professor is has been falsifying his results.

T
Tell his friend who works at the university's newspaper all about it, so they can write up an expose on his professor.
F

Go to the head of the school and ask for their opinion on the situation.
[It is best not to accuse anyone of anything just yet, but he definitely needs to tell someone. Some universities have a specific person in each school who students can approach for these kinds of concerns, but if there is no one nominated, the head of the school or the vice-head is who you should approach]

Consider the following methodology, which can be considered an argument field.
Conversation analysis is a well-defined method and school of thought that analyses language from a social perspective. It seeks to study naturally occurring talk, either in everyday conversations or institutional settings such as schools and organizations. Any conversation analysis must be strictly based on the actual conversation, and outside categories (such as the race or class of the speaker) cannot be imposed unless they are referred to in the conversation being analyzed. Conversation analysts seek to find out what actions are  performed by speakers in conversation (e.g. Telling stories, making  arrangements), and how they organize their talk in order to do that. They use a special mode of analysis to understand how actions are performed in talk called the next turn proof procedure. In this procedure, the action of the speaker is understood by examining how the following speaker understood them. When discussing the organization of talk, conversation analysts use terms such as turns, sequence organization and repair (how speakers fix errors in their talk)” When thinking about Conversation Analysis as an argument field, what is a specialized process of thought?

Consider the following abstract for an academic journal article.
Mega-events, such as the Olympic Games and world fairs, are a major factor in tourism development, urban revitalization, and urban reimaging strategies. However, despite their economic, social, and political significance, it is only within the last decade that substantial attention has been paid to their impact and legacies. This article provides a discussion of the scope and definition of mega-events, an analysis of the reasons why mega-events are held, and offers an  examination of the housing and social impact of mega-events on host cities and regions with special reference to the housing and social planning of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The article concludes that the focus on the economic dimension of events is often at the expense of social, environmental, and political analyses. (Hall, C. M., & Hodges, J. (1996). The party's great, but what about the hangover?: The housing and social impacts of mega-events with special reference to the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

Have a look at the following argument. What is one problem with the argument?
According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 24, everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours. I have been working an unreasonable amount of hours. Therefore, I have the right to leave work after lunch.

Check one option.

The conclusion doesn't logically follow the premises.
F
The premises are not logically connected.
F
The first premise is not valid.
F
The second premise is not strong, because the definition of 'reasonable' is unclear and needs to be further illustrated.
T

The second premise is not strong, because the definition of 'reasonable' is unclear and needs to be further illustrated.
[For this premise to support the conclusion the arguer would need to give a much clearer understanding of what 'reasonable' is. In this sense, both premises would need further support to better clarify what 'reasonable' working hours are in the arguer's context and how the arguer's working hours are unreasonable]

[Even if we can accept the two premises as good quality, there is an issue with the conclusion that the arguer can leave work in the middle of the day. If there is a contracted time of employment (e.g. 9am-5pm) then it would not be acceptable to simply leave after lunch. A more reasonable conclusion would be that for the arguer to discuss compensation or a change in work routines with a manager, HR, or a union representative]

F
All homeless people are unemployed.
T

F

All homeless people are unemployed.
[This is a generalization that might have come up through observation, but it is not supported by evidence, which shows evidence to the contrary.

Have a look at the following passage. What is wrong with the counter-argument?
Argument: Research suggests that restorative and reparative punishments, such as community-service sentences, result in a reduction of repeat offenders. This is particularly the case for minor, non-violent offenses. The justice system should reduce the amount of prison sentences and increase the number of community-service sentences for minor, non-violent offences.*
Counter-argument: According to crime statistics, between 50% and 60%  of all released prisoners will re-offend. If you take criminals out of jail  and let them free on the street you will be putting innocent people's  lives in danger. *

Consider the following argument:
The Artape people have lived on the island of Staples for between 20,000 and 25,000 years. A number of archaeological sites have been radiocarbon dated to around 19,000 BC, although there is evidence of some tools being used by hunters as early as 23,000 BC. They are thought to have migrated across from Africa on land bridges that existed before the last ice age. Archaeological evidence, such as oral stories, rock pictures and some ancient fossils, suggests that there was trade between the main land and the smaller island across these land  bridges, but this stopped when the seas rose around 12,000 years ago. *Fictional people & history

Consider the following argument:
The Artape people have lived on the island of Staples for between 20,000 and 31,000 years. A number of archaeological sites have been radiocarbon dated to around 20,000 BC. They are thought to have migrated across from Africa on land bridges that existed before the last ice age. Movement between the main land and Staples across these land bridges was quite common. Archaeological evidence, such as oral stories, rock pictures and some ancient fossils, suggests that the Staler people, the ancestors of the Artape, used the island for hunting from as far back as 31,000 BC. However, there is no evidence of settlement or continuous habitation of the island until around 25,000 BC, when evidence of temporary camps starts. It is not until 20,000 BC that we start to see evidence of permanent dwellings. All migration from the main land to Stapes stopped when the seas rose around 12,000 years ago. * *Fictional peoples & History

People lived on the island of Staples as far back as 19,000 BC. Man-made artifacts have been found at a number of archaeological sites. These man-made artifacts have been carbon dated to 19,000 BC. For example, a partial leg bone of a juvenile marsupial herbivore was discovered at one of the sites. This partial leg bone has been sharpened into a bone point. There is clear evidence of sharp stone tools being used to refine the bone, which were also found at the site. The fossil has no carnivore tooth marks on it and was found in a shelter on a steep escarpment unsuitable for climbing by this kind of marsupial herbivore. Only humans have the capability and dexterity to make and use these kinds of tools. This leg bone tool, therefore, was made by humans. This serves as evidence that humans lived on the island of Staples as far back as 19,000 BC. * *Fictional historical account

Homeless people should be allowed to occupy unused buildings that are owned by others (commonly referred to as "squatting"), as there are an estimated 700 000 empty properties in England that could be used as shelter. Any right that owners may claim to property is superseded by the rights of homeless people to shelter, as the right to shelter is an inalienable human right. This right to shelter applies in almost all cases of unoccupied properties, but of course would not apply if the property was only unoccupied in the short term. (Adapted from Vasudevan, A. (2011, November 3). The sinister logic behind criminalising squatting. The Guardian. Retrieved from https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/03/criminalising-squatting-law-trespass-homeless) "Any right that owners may claim to property is superseded by the rights of homeless people to shelter" is which part of the Toulmin model of argumentation?

Consider the following reflection from a university course in Education. Note that this particular reflection had a word limit of 200-550 words, and students were instructed to reflect on the idea of being a critically reflective teacher.
Stephen Brookfield (1995), in his analysis of why critical reflection is important to teaching, suggests that "an uncritical stance towards our practice sets us up for a lifetime of frustration" (para. 2). He suggests this is because teachers can have a different view of their classrooms to what is actually going on: they are unaware. This contradiction fascinates me. While on my prac placements, I was particularly conscious of this - lessons that I thought to be fantastic or boring, when looked at through a critical eye, turned out to be the opposite, or at least more in the middle. It was frustrating, to say the least. What we had learnt in our education theory courses didn't quite match up to real-life experience. Having my supervisor give me notes at the end really helped me in evaluating my teaching and planning the next lesson. This, coupled with my own observations of my students allowed me to more closely align what Brookfield would call the "meaning and significance" (para 2) I intended for the lesson to what the students took from it. While being observed sometimes felt a bit "big brother" and sometimes just embarrassing, I have no doubt that it made me a better teacher. These kinds of 'learning processes' throughout a teaching career are important because they force us to reevaluate our practice; to, in effect, become aware. Brookfield, S. (1995).

Read the following argument. Which sentences are part of the argument chain?
(1) Better data on homelessness would ultimately contribute to a decrease in homelessness. (2) There is currently a need for a client information system that would help provide assessment, referrals and information sharing across the multiple homelessness services. (3) Improved communication across the different services would ensure that the clients' needs are being addressed. (4) Moreover, improved data would help identify which services are most in demand. (5) If the in-demand services were identified then it would mean greater resources could be allocated to those areas.

Consider the following fictional newspaper article.
Homeless man Mike Davis pulled himself back on his feet with some hard work in his new microbusiness, cleaning local restaurants and bars. While his microbusiness might have given him a newfound sense of dignity, along with a few dollars, Mike confessed to his case manager Susan Lee at New Choices Welfare that he still had a unfulfilled dream - to find his long-lost sister in the city of Bramingham. That's when Susan, in conjunction with Flyaway Travel, worked to make Mike's dream a reality … A cultural studies theorist critiques the article in the following way. Another example of the responsibilisation of homelessness can be seen in an article in the Southern Messenger (Diaz, 2011). A narrative of individual self-help, supported by the newspaper's advertisers, is told, ignoring the broader systemic nature of homelessness.

This ideology then reinforces how the broader housing system, that prioritizes the exchange-value of houses on the market rather than their use-value as accommodation, creates a homeless underclass.
