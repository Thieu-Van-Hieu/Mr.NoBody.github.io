It's 4.30pm, and mary has just submitted her essay for introduction to microbiology online. She feels pretty confident she did well. She spent a lot of time researching, and was able to provide good evidence for most of her claims. However, as she is closing down her computer she realizes that she accidentally submitted her draft version, which is missing many of her in-text and end-of-text references for her assignment. The online form won't let her submit the essay again. Mary is very concerned that this will be counted as plagiarism. What should mary do?

Stuart is an international student not used to writing in english. He has a 1,000 word essay due in a week. He knows that while his ideas are good, his structure and grasp of academic language are pretty bad. He asks his friend liam, a native english speaker, to check his essay for him and suggest how he can improve it.
When liam gives him the essay back, stuart is amazed. Liam has nicely re-written whole paragraphs of stuart's ideas and obviously put a lot of effort into making it sound academic.
However, stuart is a little worried because he can barely recognize the essay - he even had to translate a few words! 
What kind of academic misconduct would stuart be committing if he handed it in?

Myer has just had a really long day and is finishing up a physics experiment in the lab. When myer goes to save the data she's been working on, her computer malfunctions and she is forced to restart it. Unfortunately, because of this, myer has just lost all of the results from the experiments she's been doing for the past three hours.
Myer is horrified and quickly starts to write down all of the numbers that she remembers. She can accurately remember half of them, is pretty confident about another 30%, but has no idea what the final 20% are. She checks the time and realizes that if she starts the experiment again she will be in the lab until 11pm, and she is already exhausted. What should myer do?

"british r.a.f. sergeant nicholas stephen alkemade fell around 5.5km from a burning airplane during world war 2 without a parachute. He fell through pine trees and landed in fresh snow, but survived. Explain how this is possible, assuming a person can withstand 15, 000 newtons over 5 seconds and survive*."
*please do not test this at home, this number is not accurate!
In answering this question, what would you do after you have defined and think you understand the question?

Check one option.

Explain that it is possible if and only if the depth of snow was greater than 20m and its density was less than 600 kg/m3.
F
Write down all the things you know that might relate: for example, acceleration due to gravity is 9.8m/s2; fresh snow is soft; trees branches would help break the fall; air resistance would slow you down; human flesh and bone can withstand certain amounts of force before they are damaged.
T
Write down all the things you know related to how it happened: for example, he was british and survived, therefore he probably landed in england; the germans most likely shot down the plane.
F

Write down all the things you know that might relate: for example, acceleration due to gravity is 9.8m/s2; fresh snow is soft; trees branches would help break the fall; air resistance would slow you down; human flesh and bone can withstand certain amounts of force before they are damaged.
[if you were a physicist, you would probably be able to work out things like the terminal velocity of a human falling from 5.5km, what the density of snow is and how much it would slow you down, and what force would need to be applied in order to break bone and you would almost definitely have been taught some formulas to answer this question!]

Consider the following problem:
"the building manager for a brand new apartment building in the center of the city has been receiving complaints about how slow the elevators are. As the building is still under construction, the problem is the worst at peak hour when the workers use the lifts to bring their tools and materials up to the top floors, however he still gets a lot of complaints at other times. The building manager decides to hire a work crew to come in and try and speed up the elevators, but unfortunately they tell him it isn't possible. The construction won't be finished for another few months, so he needs to figure out how to get the elevators to work faster. It is starting to stress him out and the residents are getting more annoyed. On the day that the construction crew bring in the mirrors for the apartments on level 11, he notices that he receives no complaints. The complaints start up again the next day, but oddly when the mirrors are delivered for level 12 there are no complaints either.

Consider the following example from a university education course:
"a student, jane, has just transferred to mr b's class from a school across the country. After one term in class he notices that jane is not doing her homework. This results in jane almost failing her mid-semester test. He decides to transfer her to a lower level class with easier content. However, this actually makes the problem worse, and jane's marks continue to decline.
Describe how you would approach this problem and what measures you would take to help jane. Assessment criteria:
- definition of problem
- evidence of reflection on the issues
- evidence of logical development of ideas
- integration of relevant theory and research
- reference to academic sources appropriate to the question
- correct academic referencing: in-text and reference list
- overall level of analysis in reflection."
Using the question and the assessment criteria, which of the following would be an adequate response to this problem? 

Check two options.

"i would send jane to the councilor's office as she is obviously having difficulty settling into the new school and might miss her old friends. I would organize to meet with her parents and discuss jane's case with them as well."
F
An essay that integrates different theoretical explanations of motivation with research into student transitions into new high-schools and then details some of the major issues that those students usually face.
F
Describe a couple of diferent reasons why jane might be acting the way she is. For example, that she is lazy; that she is actually too intelligent and is acting out because she is bored in class; that she is becoming depressed because she misses her old school and friends. Support these reasons with research into student motivation, as well as research into the issues students face when they transfer to new high-schools.

Consider the following question asked in an education tutorial:
"you're on your practicum placement in a new school and a student in your science class has not done his/her homework for the second time this week. Another teacher tells you that the student is usually really good and probably just needs someone to talk to him/her. School policy states that you should give the student a lunch-time detention. What do you do?"which of the following is an appropriate response in a tutorial?

Check 3 options.

"i don't know, i'd give the student a detention because it's school policy. You have to stop disrespectful behavior quickly before it gets out of hand - they're probably just doing it because you are a practicum teacher."
T
"hmm...i think it is best to talk to the student, see what is going on. Lots of different studies suggest that an abrupt change in attitude can be a reflection of problems that the student is facing outside of school."
T
"who cares? It's only a week".
F
 "it depends on the student. I mean, if they're nice and co-operative in class, i'd be more inclined to talk to them, but if they're really disrespectful i might use it as a chance to discipline them.
T
"in this kind of situation there are a number of different actions that a practicum teacher might take. First of all, it is important to determine why the student hasn't been completing their homework: this can be done with a brief conversation. As smith (2018) suggests, talking with a student should always be done before any other action is taken..." etc.
